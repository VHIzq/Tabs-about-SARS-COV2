                    Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    Viral mutations and variants in the United States are routinely monitored through sequence-based surveillance, laboratory studies, and epidemiological investigations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and P.1 (Gamma) variants circulating in the United States are classified as variants of concern.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Laboratory studies suggest specific monoclonal antibody treatments may be less effective for treating cases of COVID-19 caused by variants with certain substitutions or combinations of substitutions in the spike protein.<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            L452R is present in B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) lineages, as well as the B.1.617 (Kappa, Delta) lineages and sub-lineages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            E484K is present in B.1.525 (Eta), P.2 (Zeta), P.1 (Gamma), and B.1.351 (Beta), but only some strains of B.1.526 (Iota) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The combination of K417N, E484K, and N501Y substitutions is present in B.1.351 (Beta).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The combination of K417T, E484K, and N501Y substitutions is present in P.1 (Gamma).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    Viruses constantly change through mutation. A variant has one or more mutations that differentiate it from other variants in circulation. 
                    As expected, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented in the United States and globally throughout this pandemic. 
                    To inform local outbreak investigations and understand national trends, scientists compare genetic differences between viruses to identify variants and how they are related to each other.

                    A variant with specific genetic markers that have been associated with changes to receptor binding, reduced neutralization by antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments, potential diagnostic impact, or predicted increase in transmissibility or disease severity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Possible attributes of a variant of interest:<br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific genetic markers that are predicted to affect transmission, diagnostics, therapeutics, or immune escape.</li>
                        <li>vidence that it is the cause of an increased proportion of cases or unique outbreak clusters.</li>
                        <li>Limited prevalence or expansion in the US or in other countries.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    A variant of interest might require one or more appropriate public health actions, including enhanced sequence surveillance, enhanced laboratory characterization, or epidemiological investigations to assess how easily the virus spreads to others, the severity of disease, the efficacy of therapeutics and whether currently authorized vaccines offer protection.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Variant of Concern: A variant for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., increased hospitalizations or deaths), significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures.

                    Traditional vaccine development can take 15 years or more, starting with a lengthy discovery phase in which vaccines are designed and exploratory preclinical experiments are conducted. 
                    This is usually followed by a phase in which more formal preclinical experiments and toxicology studies are performed and in which production processes are developed. 
                    During this process an investigational new drug (IND) application is filed and the vaccine candidate then enters phase I, II and III trials. If, when phase III trials are completed, the predetermined end points have been met, a biologics licence application (BLA) is filed, reviewed by regulatory agencies and finally the vaccine is licensed. 
                    After that point, large-scale production begins. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 is following an accelerated timeline. Because of knowledge gained from the initial development of vaccines for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the discovery phase was omitted. 
                    Existing processes were adopted, and phase I/II trials were started. Phase III trials were initiated after the interim analysis of phase I/II results, with several clinical trial stages running in parallel.
